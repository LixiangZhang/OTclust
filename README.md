# OTclust
R package OTclust

Providing mean partition for ensemble clustering by optimal transport alignment(OTA), uncertainty measures for both partition-wise and cluster-wise assessment and multiple visualization functions to show uncertainty, for instance, membership heat map and plot of covering point set. A partition refers to an overall clustering result.

Note: it was a previous CRAN package, but archived due to a test environment issue on Debian Linux and Ubuntu Linux (r-hub/rhub#567).
